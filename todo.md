project.todo
	- Fix player start position, should be behind the desk at the top. @done
	- Fix artwork in opening room @done
	- Fix end credits
		- S: Partially done, now plays/disapears correctly, not sure if you wanna add more
	- Opening credit font is Didot in the original version. @done
	- Check on video player in room 3 (Video texture no longer emmissive) @done
	- Room 1 messages, this is mostly done. @done
	- might change screen a little in theater @done
	- Sound mixing and levels
	- Potential interaction with objects in opening room (small, I haven't thought this through yet), one that comes to mind is having the radio show pause when you hit E on the radio and play 1station.wav (which is me just saying, "theres only one station" then it resumes the radio show)
	- Neon sign change message upon respawn @done
	- Skybox - Maybe like a night sky thing? I dont like the bright sky The fog seems to be the issue, especially when you look down. @done
	- Replace portrait @done
	- Image in opening, park.png is in the materials folder, I dont know if it'll show up in engine cuz I added it through the finder rather than the engine.
	- I think I wanna be able to crouch? @done
	- Shadows seem a bit weird in the opening, specifically the trash can and the chair in front of the desk @done
	- Same with collision boxes RE the front of the character, I think the First Person Character is still compensating for his arms that aren't there. @done
	- Trigger sound hallway (small click) @done
