	- Fix player start position, should be behind the desk at the top. @done
	- Fix artwork in opening room @done
	- Fix end credits
	- Opening credit font is Didot in the original version.
	- Check on video player in room 3 (Video texture no longer emmissive) @done
	- Room 1 messages, this is mostly done. @done
	- might change screen a little in theater
	- Sound mixing and levels
	- Potential interaction with objects in opening room (small, I haven't thought this through yet)
	- Neon sign change message upon respawn
	- Skybox - Maybe like a night sky thing? I dont like the bright sky
	- Replace portrait
	- Image in opening
	- I think I wanna be able to crouch?
	- Shadows seem a bit weird in the opening, specifically the trash can and the chair in front of the desk
	- Same with collision boxes RE the front of the character, I think the First Person Character is still compensating for his arms that aren't there.
	- Trigger sound hallway (small click)
